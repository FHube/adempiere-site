The query reduces the number of records in a window to allow the entry criteria in an improved &quot;query by example&quot; (query by example) style.</li>\n<li>The users themselves can adjust the outline of the window and can define special screens for a specific customer situation or when so required.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"intelligent-reports\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Intelligent Reports</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports Listings through the system viewer are based on the data dictionary, since the report viewer has access to data definitions, it natively allows Drill down and drill-across searches.</li>\n<li>Data linkages are generated automatically, adhering to security access definitions in real time.</li>\n<li>All report outputs can be previewed on screen before printing or generating files in several standard formats (eg. Excel, HTML, XML, Word and PDF).</li>\n<li>Drill (Drill-down) a new report is generated based on the selected entity, reports where the number is a sum of numbers or accessed from an accrued monthly to the original transaction amount.</li>\n<li>Browse References (Drill-across) allows the user to create a new report in which a specific entity being used.</li>\n<li>The lists are based on information from the windows. You can generate a report for each system screen.</li>\n<li>The reports are usually based on summarized information based on reports views.</li>\n<li>The OLAP Viewer can display different dimensions in a table or a graph.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"sustainable-architecture\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Sustainable Architecture</h2>\n<p>Business applications change over time. They need to leverage new technologies and provide additional smarter functionality. Even canned applications should even support additional functionality, although usually not appropriate for integration with the functional core of a growing business.</p>\n<p>Adempiere uses the following design principles to create a sustainable architecture:</p>\n<p>Smalltalk MVC Architecture which is a derivation of the Model-View-Controller approach. Explicit Rules Engine for complex Transaction Logic and transaction safe fail recovery.</p>\n<p>ERP has an object architecture each object is as independent as possible from other objects, including transactional derivation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"safe-fail\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Safe-Fail</h2>\n<p>Usually the applications are designed to be free of faults (fail-safe): It is assumed that everything works and that all data are entered correctly and are consistent. In case of failure, experts must find the cause and check if there was damage. The user usually notices the problem. The reality is that applications sometimes fail.</p>\n<p>In contrast ADempiere is designed to be safe-fail. Each transaction can be repeated and regenerated. Most failures are identified by the system and the user can try to solve the problem. If recovery is not possible, the error is isolated and the rest of the system continues to work. Decoupled design is based transaction is enabled.</p>\n<p>The system checks regularly whether a transaction is complete. If a transaction is not complete and consistent due to a system failure, the administrator and the user is informed.</p>\n<p>As applications become more complex with ever increasing combinations, the errors grow exponentially. ERP provides a framework for extensive validation and in case of failure, isolate the problem by ensuring high availability of the central functions (application kernel).</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Security</h2>\n<p>ADempiere supports data security and functions. The safety function is based on User Roles and Access Controls Windows, Reports and Processes.</p>\n<p>The data security for customer information and the Organization is maintained at the level of the database through the security context. This is an additional level of security beyond identification (login) regular user of the database. This allows the use of third-party tools based on SQL to access the database. Before accessing any data the user must be identified through a stored procedure (stored procedure) with username, password and optionally language role. This provides the same access rules for third-party tools that may exist in the application.</p>\n<p>Most applications do not have a layer of security beyond the user ID of the database and have difficulty restricting access through third-party SQL tools.</p>\n<p>The Customer Passwords are stored in encrypted form.</p>\n",

The main focus was to have the core of the software being executed on a central server while clients connect to it to access data and do the business logic locally.</p>\n<p>Ironically think have swung back to where they originally started, as there was a mainframe with dumb terminals which only displayed data to users without any kind of complex data processing.</p>\n<p>I was not present at the age where it was needed a white coat to access to big data centers consisting of several IBM 390s or Systems 36 with hundreds of terminals (ATMs). But today, the context is in a way similar to these former times: there are big data centers -which by the way have helped to reduce costs- with rented servers accessed on a virtual way for a couple of hundreds dollars a month (Amazon, Google Cloud, Heroku to name a few). The main difference now is that applications have to service thousands or even millions of users, the capability of being able to scale up horizontally is an usual requirement nowadays; these new context demands that applications are designed differently as the requirements are totally different.</p>\n<p>The access to these servers is made by gadgets which though not totally dumb, they execute client applications run on a web browser whose only task is to interpret java script or HTML code, where the highest value is standardization and integration of multiple operating systems and platforms.</p>\n<p>In the next decade the main focus was in developing applications based on the model view controller paradigm <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MVC</a> (2), which allowed code separation.</p>\n<p>The model layer allows the access and updating of data, mostly saved in a relational database. On the other side it allows to work with Object-relational mapping (ORM) which consist of an abstraction on the database and persistency, replacing the usage of SQL sentences depending on the implementation of a motor implemented on every database.</p>\n<p>The view layer separates the code for displaying and for user interaction via an user interface, which is implemented according to the access gadget.</p>\n<p>The controller layer is in charge of linking the view layer with the data model, and implements the code that responds to the actions needed.</p>\n<p>When we analyze the code of ADempiere in retrospective, we can see the course of time and evolution of underwent. It went from the original client/server based on Java swing with direct database access via pure SQL sentences to the current own ORM combined with SQL to access the data and the MVC application based on te AJAX web client.</p>\n<p>Even though technology has moved on, our domain model has persisted; that is why we can infer that the most important asset of ADempiere is the Application Dictionary which preserves the domain model and the business logic.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the fact that ADempiere was drafted and developed on a Model Driven Architecture <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MDA</a> (3), the domain model is protected of obsolescence by the Application Dictionary</p>\n<p>As a voluntary person, responsible for the future architecture of beloved ADempiere, we will adopt the DDD approach as the main line of development.</p>\n<p><strong>Now: what is a software development guided by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Domain Driven Design DDD</a>(4)?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DDD</strong> is an approach for developing software with complex requirements and having a deep linkage to a model that defines the core of the business logic being developed.\nThe most important commandments to develop and maintain a domain model are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place the main focus of the project in the core and the business logic of the domain.</li>\n<li>All complex designs are based on a domain model.</li>\n<li>Initiate a creative collaboration between technicians and domain model experts to define iteratively a model that addresses the particular problems of the domain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/patterns/DDD_Reference_2011-01-31.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Domain Driven Design</a> (5) is not a technology nor a methodology. It is a set of patterns towards the building of business applications starting from the domain model, which provides an useful, practical structure with consistent terminology for decision-making in the course of designing software.</p>\n<p><strong>Domain:</strong> a knowledge sphere (ontology), influence or activity. The area where an user applies a program is the software domain.\n<strong>Model:</strong> a set of abstractions describing sections of a selected domain than can be used to solve problems or tasks related to that domain.\n<strong>Ubiquitous language:</strong> a structured language in the context of a domain model and used by all team members to interconnect all team activities.\n<strong>Context:</strong> the scenario in which a word or statement defines her meaning.\nA purely technical vision for the software development could be the migration to a multiple layer application (persistency layer, access data layer, service layer and presentation layer).\n<strong>DDD</strong> is not quarrel with any technology or design pattern for example <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dependency Injection DI</a> (6),</p>\n<p>but without change there is a very important premise The domain model should remain isolated from the outer layers! since any technological change should not affect my core business.</p>\n<p><strong>Important Premise:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The model must be kept isolated from the external layers! The reason: no technological change should affect the core of the business.</li>\n<li>Each layer is a concentric circle which defines a software area; while moving from the center to the outer levels the software evolves. The outer circles are mechanisms, while the inner circles are the conditions.</li>\n<li>The most important rule for this architecture is the dependency rule.</li>\n<li>As a rule, dependencies within the source code can point only towards the center. Nothing in an inner circle can know about anything in an outer circle. Moreover, any declared name in an outer circle cannot be mentioned by the code of an inner circle. This includes function calls, classes, variables or any other software entity.</li>\n<li>Due to the same reason, the data formats used in an outer circle cannot be used by an inner circle, especially if these formats are generated in a ORM from an outer circle. It is our intention that nothing from an outer circle affects the inner circles.</li>\n<li>This way, for interacting between circles or layers is paramount to establish an API which allows the communication between inner and outer layers by means of adapters or messages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some architectures based on this view; they are similar and differ in some points, but coincide in the importance of a domain model <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hexagonal architecture</a> (7), <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/10/ddd-onion-architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Onion Architecture</a> (8), <a href=\"http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Clean Architecture</a> (9).</p>\n<p>As the way of defining how we will build the software around ADempiere is crucial, we will adopt the clean/Onion architecture, where the main focus is to keep clean the domain model interacting with the outer layers by means of contracts (APIs or interfaces) which allow to conveniently separate the domain model of the implementations (API or contract). This will provide for an ordered evolution avoiding technological obsolescence.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we will define a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Domain Specific Language DSL</a> (10) for ADempiere focussed on the business, allowing the building of our ubiquitous language and clearly delimiting the contexts. This helps a more natural development of the business logic.\nAs stated before, every decision has to be authorized by the benefits to be gained; moving towards DDD will allow us to obtain the following benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>The Benefits:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decoupled code</li>\n<li>Reduce spaghetti code</li>\n<li>Traversal Services independent of the domain model (Log , Transactions , Security ).</li>\n<li>Code easy to maintain</li>\n<li>Software adaptable to changes</li>\n<li>Design based on components</li>\n<li>Contexts delimited by the business process</li>\n<li>Build our own testing sets (functional, integration, regression test)</li>\n<li>Better handling of dependencies and modularity.</li>\n<li>Create a DSL (Domain-specific language) (9) for the business</li>\n<li>Build to Adempiere as a Reactive System (11) (Responsive , Resilient , Elastic , Message Driver)</li>\n<li>An application designed for the demands of today</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important that developers interested in participating in this big project become familiar with concepts and terminology.</p>\n<p>In the next months and weeks, I will continue writing more articles with concrete examples permitting discussion.</p>\n<p>Victor Perez\nAn ADempiere founder\nvictor.perez@e-evolution.com</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(1) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client–server_model</a></li>\n<li>(2) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller</a></li>\n<li>(3) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-driven_architecture</a></li>\n<li>(4) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design</a></li>\n<li>(5) <a href=\"http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/patterns/DDD_Reference_2011-01-31.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://domainlanguage.com/ddd/patterns/DDD_Reference_2011-01-31.pdf</a></li>\n<li>(6) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection</a></li>\n<li>(7) <a href=\"http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture</a></li>\n<li>(8) <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/10/ddd-onion-architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/10/ddd-onion-architecture</a></li>\n<li>(9) <a href=\"http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html</a></li>\n<li>(10) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language</a></li>\n<li>(11) <a href=\"http://www.reactivemanifesto.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.reactivemanifesto.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>We are pleased to announce the launch of a new and improved content portal for ADempiere thus reaching another milestone following the release of version 380, which confirms the traction and commitment from our community and all those behind this great Bazaar project.</p>\n<p>A group of committed people worked hard for several months to build a professional and informative site for our business solution, a place where people will find all the required information to evaluate our process management tools, breaking dependence from a particular software provider and avoiding high license costs and more important not requiring long term commitments from third parties to install, extend and/or customize it.</p>\n<p>The portal offers an overview of the history, functionality, features, benefits and success stories on ADempiere, but also allows to quickly download an installer, swift access to source code, bug tracking and browsing the forums to learn from other organizations using Adempiere worldwide.</p>\n<p>A new publishing platform has been adopted that will allow a more effective maintenance and keeping up with the project’s documentation for current and future enhancements on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>We also have moved away from the historic SourceForge repository to a more professional and secure version control system thus all code and collaboration platform ADempiere moved to Git: www.github.com/Adempiere, which hosts hundreds of open source projects with thousands of developers working actively and collaboratively for the success of their own projects. We also moved the binaries distribution to http://www.bintray.com/adempiere which also serves many other professional software open source projects and malware free.</p>\n<p>We started with a new tool to manage and control the discussion forums where information and knowledge will be managed by the community allowing you to create a knowledge base for the benefit of all those involved.</p>\n<p>On the other hand we are in the process of migrating information from the old sourceforge forums to our platform to protect the knowledge generated by the 10-year project.</p>\n<p>We have created a chat room for developers to collaborate on the development of future versions within http://gitter.im/adempiere the channel is public and anyone with github account can access it and free to participate.</p>\n<p>An important additional point worth mentioning is that the portal is a place where the interested parties can find business consulting services from professional experts, certified and experienced partners that have successfully deployed Adempiere throughout the years.</p>\n<p>We have created a certification program that enables our associates qualify by successfully documented cases of guaranteeing the quality and knowledge of the solution.</p>\n<p>Incorporate a training plan to train experts in ADempiere consultants that implement best business practices in the sales process, distribution management, supply chain, manufacturing, production control, financial management and human capital.</p>\n<p>We established a very successful contribution process by integrating the best features of business and validated in successful implementations, allowing customers the benefits are not obtained proprietary software manufacturers since this project to be led by the community, customers dictate improvements and functionality for future versions.</p>\n<p>For version 4 we will focus on the technological renovation to compete with the demands of today, creating a new UI for mobile devices and the development of a new web interface with support for HTML5 responsive, in the next release ADempiere will support Java 8 consciously decided to wait for the release of Java 9 in particular the Jigsaw project that will become the standard for Java modularization.</p>\n<p>We want to thank all contributors who made this great company, I invite anyone who wants to collaborate with this great project.</p>\n<p>Sincerely</p>\n<p>Victor Perez Juarez</p>\n<p>Founder of ADempiere</p>\n<p>On behalf of the Community of ADempiere</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<h2 id=\"basic-rules-of-the-community\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Basic Rules of the Community</h2>\n<p>This Code of Conduct covers your behavior as a member of the ADempiere Community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, public meeting or private correspondence. The ADempiere Association arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.</p>\n<p><strong>Be considerate</strong>. Your work will be used by other people, and you depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, andwe hope you will take into account the consequences when making decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Be respectful</strong>. The ADempiere community and its members treat each other with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to the ADempiere project. You may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We can all experience some frustration now and then, but we can not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. It is important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not productive. We expect members of the ADempiere community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Adempiere Project</p>\n<p><strong>Be collaborative</strong>. The ADempiere project and Free Software are all about collaboration and teamwork. Collaboration reduces redundancy of work done in the Free Software world, and improves the quality of the software produced. You should try to work with other ADempiere implementers, as well as others in the communitymay be interested in the work you do. Your work should be done transparently and patches of Adempiere, when performed, should be given to the community. If you want to work on new code for new projects, at least keep those projects informed of your ideas and progress. It may not be possible to obtain the consensus of the project or even from your colleagues about the correct implementation of an idea, so do not feel obliged to have that agreement before you begin, but at least keep informedthe outside world of your work, and publishyour work in a way that allowsothers to test, discuss and contribute to your efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>When you disagree, check</strong>. Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and the ADempiere community is no exception. The important thing is not to avoid disagreements or differences of opinion but to resolve them constructively. Go to the community and the community process to seek advice and to resolve disagreements.The ADempierecommunity will help you decide the right course for the project. There are also several Project Teams and Team. Leaders, who may be able to help you figure out which direction would be moreacceptable. If you really want to go a different way, then we encourage you to make a derivative distribution or alternative set of packages available using the framework of ADempiere package management, so that the community can try these changes and ideas for themselves and contribute to the discussion.</p>\n<p><strong>When you are unsure, ask for help</strong>. Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the ADempiere community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, so we encourage questions. Theperson you ask would most probable be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, you must be careful to do so in an appropriate forum.</p>\n<p><strong>Leave with consideration</strong>. Developers on every project come and go and the ADempiere project is no different. When youleave the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you're working with you, you are leaving and take appropriate measures to ensure that others can pick up where you leave.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shearing\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Shearing</h2>\n<p>The Code of Conduct ADempiere is based on Ubuntu Code of Conduct. You can re-use it for your own project, and modify it as you wish, and when you allow others to use your modifications,please give credit to the ADempiere project.</p>\n",

In order to achieve this, they hired external advice from a German company called ADV/Orga, where Jorg Janke worked as software architect.</p>\n<p>Jorg's recommendation was to rewrite R/2 which would have put in place the required multidimensional features and as such conquered the world of ERP solutions. However SAP's decision at the end involved adding more layers to the core ERP programming structures, which in turn created inefficiencies and complexities that even today subsist on most SAP implementations and other ERP software as well.</p>\n<p>After this period, Jorg Janke held other important positions with other well-known ERP vendors, until he managed to get some financing from a multinational tire manufacturer Goodyear where he was retained to develop a custom ERP that will leverage multidimensional functionality, and will allow easy customizations based on design principles that that were originally rejected by SAP.</p>\n<p>A little more than 15 years have gone and that system originally created by Jorg Janke has now evolved into ADempiere ERP a world class open source enterprise sotware package which is design from its beginnings to be easy to extend, and easy to implement.</p>\n",

(ADeV) is the representative of the free and open ERP system Adempiere. The association is understood to be the active partner of companies and persons which implement and develope ADempiere.</p>\n<h3 id=\"_1-name-headquarters-and-fiscal-year\" tabindex=\"-1\"> 1.

If no fixed office has been set up, the administration shall be carried out at the residence of the respective management board member who carries out executive management duties.</li>\n<li>The fiscal year shall be the calendar year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"_2-association-s-purpose\" tabindex=\"-1\"> 2. Association's purpose</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The purpose of the association is the promotion and dissemination of free ERP software in the sense of free software while taking the Adempiere programme package into special consideration. Free software, also referred to as &quot;open source software&quot;, in accordance with this charter is considered to be computer programmes which are provided free of charge to the general public by the author in a non-retrievable manner. The author thus grants to third parties the freedom to use the programme for any purpose, to examine how the programme functions and to modify it for one's own needs, to make copies for other persons and to improve the programme and to make these improvements available to the general public.</li>\n<li>The association's purpose is particularly realised through\n<ul>\n<li>The promotion of education, the exchange of opinions and the cooperation of users, developers and researchers</li>\n<li>The continued development of and research for free ERP software</li>\n<li>The provision of free ERP software, supporting photos, sounds, data and documentation as well as the promotion of its availability and the preparation and dissemination of informational materials for it</li>\n<li>Contributions to the technical information of the public in the sphere of activities of the association and participation in trade fairs and seminars in order to make the information available to a broader spectrum of users</li>\n<li>Organisation of seminars and generally accessible presentations in order to provide continuing education to the project participants and users</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The association shall pursue no commercial purposes of its own. It shall not endeavour to earn a profit. It is not permitted to have political and ideological goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"_3-non-profit-status\" tabindex=\"-1\"> 3. Non-profit status</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In accordance with its duties that are specified in § 2 of the charter, the association is pursuing, exclusively and directly, charitable purposes in accordance with the section of the tax code regarding tax advantages (§§ 51ff. AO). It is non-profit and does not primarily pursue its own commercial goals.</li>\n<li>The funds of the association are to be used exclusively for the purposes specified in the charter. The members receive exclusively reimbursements of their costs incurred, but no direct appropriations from the association's funds.</li>\n<li>No one may benefit for expenditures of the association which are not related to the association's purpose or through disproportionately high compensation. The Federal Travel Cost Act shall be prevailing for the reimbursement of expenditures provided that no other statutory provisions are applicable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"_4-types-of-membership-and-members-of-the-association\" tabindex=\"-1\"> 4. Types of membership and members of the association</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Members of the association may be natural and juridical persons who wish to support and help to pursue the goals of the association. In order to give members the option of withdrawing from the active support of the continuing development of Adempiere without giving up their membership, the following types of memberships are available:\n<ul>\n<li>Active members are natural persons who support the association's mission and the realisation of the association's goals through cooperation and, in so doing, assume the full obligations of an association member. In particular, it is expected that they will participate in cooperations and members' meetings and exercise voting rights.</li>\n<li>Passive members are natural and juridical persons who declare their support of the association's mission and goals through their membership in the association, but opt not to exercise the rights of active members, in this case, the exercising of voting rights. Juridical persons shall designate a natural person as their representative in order to exercise any still applicable rights and obligations.</li>\n<li>Sponsoring members are natural and juridical persons who promote the association's mission and goals, particularly through a financial or non-financial contribution. At their own request, they may be listed on the association's web site and have the right to participate in members' meetings without acquiring voting rights.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Active membership may be acquired upon the recommendation of an active member subject to the approval of two other active members by means of a resolution of the members' meeting or the active members through an Internet vote with a simple majority. The main decision-making criterion for acceptance is supposed to be the candidate for acceptance's commitment shown over a longer period of time and resulting contributions made in the sense of the association's goals.</li>\n<li>Upon his own request to the management board, an active member may change his membership to a passive membership. In the aforementioned obligations of an active member are not fulfilled for two successive ordinary members' meetings, his membership shall automatically change into a passive membership. A passive member may request that the management board grant him active membership. The management board shall rule regarding the acceptance of sponsoring members.</li>\n<li>A passive member can apply for active membership at the board in case it used to an active member in the past. Otherwise 4.2 apply to gain active membership.</li>\n<li>Sponsoring membership is given by the board.</li>\n<li>The membership shall end through resignation, expulsion or death; for juridical persons, also through the loss of legal personality. The resignation of a member is possible only on 31 December of each year. Such a resignation shall be announced by means of a written declaration submitted to the management board while providing four weeks' notice.</li>\n<li>The instrument for expulsion from the association shall be reserved to critical situations whereby clarification of the issue should take precedence. Expulsion shall be made with immediate effectiveness upon a resolution of the management board. The following may be reasons for an expulsion:\n<ul>\n<li>A major violation of a member against the provisions of this charter as well as well as goals and purposes of the association after an unsuccessful attempt at clarification as well as</li>\n<li>Despite multiple warnings, payments of membership dues in arrears for a timeframe of 12 months.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Before the adopting of a resolution, the member must be given the opportunity to provide a legal justification or take a statement of position. An objection to the exclusion may be submitted to the management board within four weeks upon which the next members' meeting shall rule. Until a decision is made by the members' meeting, the rights and obligations of the member shall be suspended.</li>\n<li>If a member leaves the association or the association is dissolved, no claim to the reimbursement of financial assets that have been contributed shall apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"_5-bodies-of-the-association\" tabindex=\"-1\"> 5.

ADempiere's reporting is based on the data dictionary.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>As the report viewer has access to the definitions, this allows drill-down to any entity referenced and drill-across to entities where the reported entity is used.</li>\n<li>The links are automatically generated, while ensuring adherence to security and access definitions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The report viewer provides for the selection of data, sequencing, grouping, totalling and display formatting.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Reporting output can be viewed on screen before sending it to a printer, an email or fax address or generating files in many different formats (e.g. Excel text formats, HTML, XML, PDF and Postscript).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"business-views\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Business Views</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Business Views are designed for end users and allow information to be accessed using standard SQL based tools without the need to create SQL table joins.</li>\n<li>The majority of Business Views are generated based on the Application Dictionary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"drill-down-and-drill-across\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Drill-down and Drill-across</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All reporting output allows users to drill-down or drill-across to any entity referenced within the context of the report.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>When using drill-down, a new report is generated based on the entity selected.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In an Order report, for example, the user can drill-down to generate a report showing the order lines that make up the order.</li>\n<li><strong>The user can identify the drill-across entity (order lines) and then click on the product name to display a separate report of order lines for the particular product selected.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Following the Web-UI convention, users can drill-down to any blue underlined entity displayed on the report screen.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Drill-across allows the user create a new report about a related entity on a report. For example, in a Product report the user may wish to see order lines for a particular product.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"report-types\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Report types</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Lists - are based on Window information. Users can generate a report for every window in the system including Windows containing new user defined fields and tables. The reports can be modified to specify which fields are to be displayed, in which orderand how they are to be grouped. The report can calculate minimum, maximum, sum, count, standard deviation and variance for selected columns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reports - are usually based on summarised information and are based on Report Views. Reports allow the definition of what information is to appear in rows and what is to appear in columns, the combination of a rowset definition and a column set definition determines the report content.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"third-party-reporting-tools\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Third Party Reporting Tools</h3>\n<p>Third party tools such as Jasper Reports; a Java based equivalent of Crystal Reports, can also be used to create reports if needed. The present release of Adempiere already has JasperReports substantially integrated to its reporting engine.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customising-reports\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Customising Reports</h3>\n<p><strong>ADempiere differentiates the 'view' from the 'model'. With the exception of Report Views, the model is usually given. If you provide a SQL Select statement a Report View can be created, the user doesn't need to resolve foreign key references (which require the knowledge of the data model) or worry about data security, as ADempiere resolves these issues for the user. This allows the writing of 'simple' statements. Few people agree on how each report should look. ADempiere allows the user to define the format of any report at the System, Client, Organisation or User level:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Report columns</li>\n<li>Column order</li>\n<li>Report sorting</li>\n<li>Column heading</li>\n<li>Sums (for numeric columns)</li>\n<li>Grouping</li>\n<li>Pie Chart</li>\n<li>Bar/Line Chart</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Data selection is via Report Parameters when initiating the report, or via Query, allowing the user to enter criteria in an enhanced 'query by example' style.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"data-and-meta-data\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Data and meta-data</h2>\n<p><strong>Programmers of many applications that do not use the sophistication of an Active Data Dictionary need to design, code and test every screen. ADempiere uses the more advanced concept of a central active data dictionary, also called information repository. ADempiere's active data dictionary is at the meta-data layer, and knows how to access data and how data is related.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The data dictionary contains:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Definitions of a data entity (type, validation, etc.)</li>\n<li>Method of display (label on screens and reports, help, display sequence and position relative to other fields)</li>\n<li>Display rules</li>\n<li>Security and access rules</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The data dictionary is 'active', meaning it is used at runtime and is context sensitive. For example: it 'knows' that an over-the-counter sale does not have a payment term and does not display it. However if you change the transaction type to a standard order, a payment term becomes a mandatory part of the transaction.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Active Data Dictionary is user-extensible and can include user specified rules and information. The extensibility of the Active Data Dictionary simplifies user extensions to the application since much of what would otherwise have to be coded by programmers can be created by a knowledgeable and authorised users (with System privilege) from within the application</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"supportability\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Supportability</h2>\n<p><strong>Software Support represents a substantial portion of the lifetime costs of any complex system. A flexible, modular architecture is essential for ensuring:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understandability</li>\n<li>Modifiability</li>\n<li>Interoperability</li>\n<li>Reusability</li>\n<li>Expandability</li>\n<li>Portability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>all of which are necessary for software that can be supported in an efficient and cost effective manner. Many problems associated with software support can be traced to deficiencies in the way the original software product was designed. Lack of attention to the design of modular software architectures during development can cause excessive software support problems and costs. ADempiere is designed to be as flexible as possible and to accommodate change. Unless the system architecture allows for change, modifications to the software are likely to be difficult and defect-prone. ADempiere's software architecture carefully addresses abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding to minimize dependencies. By maximising use of object-oriented design, the software can be easily modified. ADempiere's Active Data Dictionary ensures that software support can be simplified by ensuring that changes are made in one location with a consistent impact throughout the whole of the application. Additionally, ADempiere uses no third-party toolsets which may become unsupported due to lack of interest by their respective vendors. Other than for the Oracle database itself, source code for all aspects of the system is open and available ensuring that the user community will always be able to provide support for all aspects of the system.</p>\n",

This personal exchange between community members lead to a good speed-up in the project development.</p>\n<p>To engage everyone in another personal meeting, the 2nd European ADempiere conference will take place in Berlin from June 21st till 23rd.</p>\n<p>The conference will focus on technical improvements in ADempiere and on optimizing the social structure of the ADempiere community to be even more successful in terms of development and distribution.</p>\n<p>Altogether we'll use the weekend to exchange personal experiences with the software as well as to improve documentation, code and localization – and of course to have a bunch of fun!</p>\n",

The next step in bringing together developers from all over the world is not the European Conference, but the World Conference.</p>\n<p>Now for the first time in September 2011 the ADempiere World Conference takes place at the Beuth Technical University in Berlin.</p>\n<p>The conference tries to bring together every party interested in ADempiere: Community members, service providers, users or people solely interested in ADempiere.</p>\n<p>Notable ADempiere developers will be sharing their ADempiere know how in talks or workshops with valuable best practice advice and real world use cases.</p>\n<p>We can tell from the quickly increasing number of international participants at the conference that the community was desperately waiting for an event like this.</p>\n<p>&quot;The interest and feedback we get for the world conference is just more proof for the global collaboration of community members and the growing network around ADempiere. I'm looking forward to another great experience with this positive and progressive spirit surrounding the community.&quot; – Kai Schaeffer, chairman of the ADempiere association.</p>\n<p>Another item on the World Conference agenda is the general assembly of the association and the election of a new chairman.</p>\n<p>Of course the weekend will also be used to incorporate social events to get to know each other further and to exchange know how and experiences.</p>\n",

There are contributors, developers, testers, writers, users, as well as businesses, authorities, experts, newbies and students. There is also a Council of trustees to be responsible for this community and the project's well-being.</p>\n<p>Each community has its own history and culture. This particular community has its roots within the <a href=\"http://sf.net/projects/compiere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Compiere SourceForge project</a> over the last 3 years. We started as users and implementors of this great software project, and began to progress in leaps and bounds in our own capability to master it and even extend it for various end-users.</p>\n<p>The community was generally grateful to Compiere's creator, Jorg Janke, and tolerated his business model of charging users for priority support, training and the user manual. Many of us contributed code, bug reports, fixes and recommendations on how this premiere Open Source ERP/CRM solution could continue to expand. And though Jorg Janke hardly responded to the forums' messages (even those that were directly aimed at him) the Compiere community enjoyed ample support and encouragement from other community seniors on a voluntary and vigilant basis.</p>\n<p>Trouble set in soon after ComPiere Inc, USA, the commercial entity behind this project, purportedly obtained some USD6 million funding from an &quot;angel&quot; investor who soon joined its Board of Directors. Many among the paying partners of Compiere began to question new policy directions, this led to the <a href=\"http://www.compiere.com/about/board.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Forking Debate</a>, and eventually sparked off the Adempiere community. The name &quot;Adempiere&quot; is an Italian word related to &quot;Compiere&quot; (which means &quot;to deliver or fulfill&quot;), but also semantically reflects the core ideal of this community: &quot;to fulfill towards completion, with respect and honour&quot;.\nLearn how to improve the current documentation and make it better for you and everybody!.</p>\n",

SAP decided to go down a different path by simply adding layers of functionality to their current product R/2.</p>\n<p>Later, as a senior architect at Oracle Jorg Janke wrote the first prototype for the application with the vision of how to implement the new paradigm of management programs. In 2000 he received financing from the tire manufacturer Goodyear in Germany and writes the first version of his product.</p>\n<h3 id=\"compiere\" tabindex=\"-1\"> Compiere</h3>\n<p>In 2000, Jorg founded a small company named Compiere Inc. to develop and provide support to his new product named also Compiere, an Italian word meaning &quot;complete&quot;.</p>\n<p>In a twist that became a milestone in the history of ERP solutions, Jorg decided to release his product under the licencing type: free GPL licensing mode, thus allowing it to be rapidly adopted around the world. Compiere Inc. business model then focused on supporting integrators named as &quot;Compiere Partners&quot; through first level support and value added services.</p>\n<p>At that time it was possible to offer Compiere on any platform since it was developed in 100% Java and Oracle as the database.</p>\n<h3 id=\"adempiere-is-born\" tabindex=\"-1\"> ADempiere is Born</h3>\n<p>In 2006 triggered by its product success Compiere, Inc. raises financing from a group of venture capitalists moving offices from Portrland Ore., to Silicon Valley, and at the same time, it signed a new development roadmap which included the release of new add-ons that no longer will be licensed under the previously free GPL, but rather their own Commercial License.</p>\n<p>By makinthis decision alone will eventually convert Compiere into another commercial product like most available in the market, some of his partners asked Mr. Janke to reconsider his decision but it was actually out of his reach since he had already signed an agreement with this group of investors.</p>\n<p><strong>The Call</strong></p>\n<p>Friday August 11, 2006 &quot;We are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants. We can see more, and beyond them, not because the sharpness of our sight but or the height of our body, but because we are raised by their height. &quot;</p>\n<p>In an email sent by Víctor Pérez quoting Bernardo de Chartres became the beginning of our ADempiere Community.</p>\n<p>&quot;My name is Victor Perez, I'm CEO of e-Evolution, The reason for this email and attachment is to share my dream with you and invite you to be part of it. My dream is to create an ERP, CRM, SCM solely owned by our community, a system that improves daily.</p>\n<p>In my experience, I have been working with Compiere for 5 years. I have received many satisfactions, and I took advantage of the great work done by Jorg Janke creator of Compiere.</p>\n<p>With the experience I acquired my personal dream to create a project that develops from Compiere, as a project with technology, where everyone can share their ideas, GPL, where problems of end users are heard, where I can integrate my work with the work of others, and should consider the needs of my clients, where my clients feel real support, in short something to improve.</p>\n<p>That is why I dare to invite all interested in this proposal, with a great desire to work and support this dream together full story see detail.&quot;</p>\n<p>Thus in September 2006, the group of integrators announced the decision to fork to a new product, totally free distributed under the GPL license, which ensures that it would never become a proprietary product and always remain free. The new product will be baptized with the name of ADempiere, an Italian word meaning &quot;Achieve&quot; and &quot;Reach&quot; which is defined by the tradition of other free software projects. The leadership and administration of ADempiere remained in the hands of the community and their representatives in the ADEV foundation in Germany.</p>\n<p>Since 2006, ADempiere has become the leader of the free world ERP implementations reported in nearly 120 countries and implementers covering all geographical areas of the world while its continuous development has enriched the functionlity permanently .</p>\n",
